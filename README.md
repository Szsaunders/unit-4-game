# Crystal Solver

### Instructions

Gadzooks! The evil villain Rhombo has left a supercharged doom crystal in City Hall! If you don't stabilize it, it'll blow the city apart.

The Agency has given you a set of four power crystals. Clicking on one will add a certain amount of stabilizing energy to the doom crystal, the total of which will be on the lower screen. You have to get the doom crystal to the stabilization limit on the upper screen. But be careful! If you put more stabilizing energy than the stabilization limit, the whole thing will blow up in your face!
